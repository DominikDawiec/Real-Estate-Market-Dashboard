# Krakow Real Estate Market Dashboard

This project is a **Microsoft Power BI dashboard** designed for analyzing the Krakow real estate market. Prior to developing the dashboard, a **web scraper** was used to collect data on properties for sale in Krakow ([link](https://github.com/DominikDawiec/Real-Estate-Scraper)), followed by **geospatial analysis** which included converting address data for geospatial points such as parks, supermarkets, and gyms to latitude and longitude ([link](https://github.com/DominikDawiec/Cracows-Geospatial-Data)). A Python function was also created to calculate the distance between each property for sale and a given geospatial point, including the distance from the nearest point as well as the number of points within a radius of n kilometers ([link](https://github.com/DominikDawiec/Geospatial-Real-Estate-Price-Predictor)). The final product is an **interactive and visually appealing dashboard** that presents the data in an easy-to-understand manner.
